function incr_aging( obj, n)
%INCR_AGING makes the network "age", each node of the network evolving
%randomly according to the temperature of the network and the interaction
%matrix J. The optional argument is the number of increment. For an example
%of such a network evolution you can launch the script "ex_temp"

%This version is for the high efficiency version of the neural Network, the
%neuralGrid.
